# Development Process
We can sum everyhing as:
1. Find an Issue
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make a PR and the lead devs will review it

Below we'll discuss the process in more detail.

## 1. Finding A Task
First check the currently open issues for unassigned ones.
If you'd to create a new one follow our 

## 2. Development
**Do not push to main**. You may know what you're doing, but no one will know that a merge just happened which could break other's code and cause substantial delays. Any push to merge by a non lead dev will be immediately undone without question.
Lead devs should also create PR requests and have someone else review it.

Each issue should have a mission statement and acceptance criteria detailing in a bullet list what needs to be accompolished. **Ask Questions**. The last thing we want is your code to be unused because their was confusion on an issue.
It's probable despite best efforts issues could be vauge or have wrong directives. It is your responsibility to periodically check in, ask questions, and fully understand the issue.

During development you may find that we need to change direction. Communicate this on the issue and maybe on discord.

## 3. Making a PR

Before making a PR ensure:
- All tasks in issue are completed. 99% is not done.
- Coding standards followed
- Code does not break existing code
- Merge conflicts resolved
- Description of what your work with screenshots. Also link it to the parent issues.

We may accept a PR if it's not fully ready, and may require changes even if all these criteria are met. It's not a reflection of how we view you or your efforts. 
Some reasons include:

- We think the code could be better
- It will create future merge conflicts with planned merges

# Role of Lead Developers
We want to ensure everyone can smoothly develop by removing blockers and reducing merge conflicts. If you have any questions you can always ping us on discord. 
Our lead devs are currently:
- **Lead Developer + Lead Frontend:** @Tristan (discord) and @longtimeno-c (github)
- **Lead Backend:** @clxud, @SwissArmyWrench

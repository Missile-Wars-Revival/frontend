## 🚀 Features
- Real-time game interface using WebSocket connections
- Google Maps integration
- In-app purchases via RevenueCat
- Push notifications support
- Cross-platform support (iOS & Android)

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- npm (latest version)
- Expo CLI
- iOS/Android development environment for native builds

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
Create an `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=""

# Distributed mode: the app discovers community game servers through the
# coordinator (server picker on the login screen, nearest verified server
# auto-selected). This is the only backend URL baked into release builds.
EXPO_PUBLIC_COORDINATOR_URL=https://coordinator.example.dev

# Direct/fallback mode (local dev, solo self-hosted server): used when no
# coordinator is configured or no server has been selected yet.
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.dev
EXPO_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://api.example.dev

EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_APPLE=""
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_GOOGLE=""
```

### 2. Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Development

### Running the App
```bash
npm start

### Using Expo Go
After starting the development server, press 's' to switch to Expo Go mode if needed:
This will not work with current config as there are lots of native modules that are not supported in Expo Go.
```
